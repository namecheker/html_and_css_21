        <br>
       
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the 
design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. 
Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming 
languages to build software solutions for end users.

Software engineers design and develop computer 
games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems, and middlewareâ€”to
 name just a few of the many career paths available.
